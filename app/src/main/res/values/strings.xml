    I developed the application myself and my 8 year old son for Ege. Ege loved this app and achieved a visible improvement in mathematics lessons! I am sure you or your child will too.
    \n "    " If you like this application, please make comment and give 5 stars! Thank you in advance for the nice comments you will make. \n
    "    " It took me 60 days to prepare Smart Kids. During these 60 days I worked in a very intense tempo and had sleepless nights. Because of huge working and spending time I had to add ads to my application, even if I did not want to. I apologize for the ads and thank you for your understanding. \n
    "    "Very special thanks to my wife Nilay, my colleague Barış and the android application testing guru Volkan and other friends for their support in the process of developing the Smart Kids!
    "    "See you in new applications! I ll be looking forward to see your comments and offers!</string>
